# ShapeInterface


This is a simple interface in Java Swing for obtaining colors in RGB or hex format, in the form of different shapes. 
With this program, you can

- See the resulting value and hex code for a particular RGB value.
- See the resulting value and RGB values for a particular hex value.
- Select color using sliders and see RGB and hex values.
- Fill in color for different shapes -> square, Rectangle, Circle, polygon and rounded rectangle.
- Change dimensions for shapes.
- Choose from some default colors.
- Save screen to png file.

In the near future, I am hoping to add the following functions:
- Add Alpha channel
